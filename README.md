# API---Weather-Vacation
What's the Weather Like?
Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. Using Python, I use requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Analysis
As expected, the weather becomes significantly warmer as one approaches the equator (0 Deg. Latitude). More interestingly, however, is the fact that the southern hemisphere tends to be warmer this time of year than the northern hemisphere. This may be due to the tilt of the earth.
There is no strong relationship between latitude and cloudiness. However, it is interesting to see that a strong band of cities sits at 0, 80, and 100% cloudiness.
There is no strong relationship between latitude and wind speed. However, in northern hemispheres there is a flurry of cities with over 20 mph of wind.

A high r value indicates a strong positive correlation between latitude and max temperature.

A low r values indicate a weak to no relationship between humidity and latitude.

A low r values indicate a weak positive relationship between latitude and cloudiness.

The low r values indicate that there is no real relationship between wind speed and latitude." The difference between the hemispheres doesn't seem to be significant enough to comment upon.
