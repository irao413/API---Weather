# API---Weather-Vacation
What's the Weather Like?
Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. Using Python, I use requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: "It gets hotter..."_

But, if pressed, how would you **prove** it?
